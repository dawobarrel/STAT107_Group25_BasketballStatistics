We will begin our analysis of the 2024 NBA player statistics by exploring the correlation among the variables we have within this data set.


We begin by loading in our cleaned dataset that we have saved within our repository.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)

# Load cleaned dataset
load(here::here("data", "nba2024_cleaned.RData"))
```
